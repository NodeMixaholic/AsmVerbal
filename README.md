### About numbers
* To use a digit, it is represented by using 0s, and the number of zeros will determine what digit it is.
	* For example 0 is 0, but 0000000000 is 9. 
* Put a "/" inbetween digits to make them  into numbers, for example 00/0/0 is 100, and 0000000000/0/0/00 is over 9000 (9001)

### About spaces
Use "-" as a space.

### About punctuation...
Use *PER*/*QUES*/*EXC*/*COM* as seperators between sentences, depending on their english equivalent.  

### About letters...
Use a set of 1s as as a letter, but theres a trick to it. Ok so the equation to figgure out what set of 1s to use is to take the index (the position of the alphapet) of the letter you want and subtract 27 to it.

In other words, 27-x=y, where x is the position of the alphabet of the letter you want and y is the number of 1s you need.

Also, to indicate that you want a capital letter, use ^ before the letter. To not use caps, do not use ^.

### About line breaks.
There is no line breaks.
